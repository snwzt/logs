# Hello.

I'm a student, currently studying Computer Science. 

I like doing System Administration and I know some programming too. Lately, I have been learning some low level programming too.

Here, I will write about the things I've been learning, or my opinions around them. Hence the name, slofl logs.

I like testing out new or vintage technologies. I like playing old games and I also draw.

I'm not a big social media person, here are my socials:
