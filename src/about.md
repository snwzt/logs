# Hello.

I'm a student, currently studying Computer Science. 

I know some programming and I like doing a little system administration too.

Here, I will write about the things I've been learning, or my opinions around them.

I like testing out new or vintage technologies. I like playing old games and I also draw.

I'm not a big social media person, here are my socials:
